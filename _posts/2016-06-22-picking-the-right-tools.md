All to often I encounter software developers who love to talk about how great language ‘x’ is or product ‘x’ is the next best thing since sliced
bread. Usually this conversation creeps up when a new project is kicking off and the initial design decisions are being made. The decisions made at
the beginning usually end up sticking around for the lifetime of a project so its is really important that they are well researched and thought out.


One of my personal beliefs is always picking the right tool for the job. Whether it's woodworking, digging a hole or software development. There is
always a tool best suited for the job at hang. For software there is some easy criteria that I follow:

1. Do I have to re-invent the wheel with must have features?
2. Can I easily employ additional resources with expertise in the given tool?
3. Is it well documented?
4. Is there a support community behind it?
5. Remove emotion from the decision making process.


Most of the above criteria seem logical and probably obvious, but often the human factor comes in to play and poor decisions are made. It’s well
worthwhile allocating the time to accurate specify what you need and thus making good decisions. As said above, most decisions made in the planning
phase usually stick due to the cost involved in changing.
