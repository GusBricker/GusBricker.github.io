Previously I have always hosted my websites using some sort of dynamic CMS such as Joomla or Wordpress. Whilst they are both fantastic platforms, they
traditionally require a lot of management. Instead I decided to switch to Jekyll - a static blogging platform which can be hosted for free by Github!

Pointers
--------

**Locally install Jekyll:**

    gem install github-pages

This gets you a similar setup to Github Pages, thus allowing hosting locally for testing.

    jekyll serve --watch

The above command launches builds and launches the site. Beware if your site has other prerequisites such a less scripts then you will have to build
those if they change.

**Pick a theme:**

The Jekyll Github page has some nice themes [here](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Themes). Experiment locally with this theme. When you are happy, push to Github.

**Build scripts:**

Consider setting up a build script to make your life easier. For example, at the time of writing the [build
script](https://github.com/GusBricker/GusBricker.github.io/blob/master/build.sh) for this site generates any Javascript, CSS and then launches the
site locally.
